# Frontend & Backend environment variables for local development with Vite/Node
# IMPORTANT:
# - Never commit real secrets to source control.
# - Keys below are placeholders. Replace with your own when running locally.
# - Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the browser.
# - Backend (Node) reads variables without VITE_ via process.env.
