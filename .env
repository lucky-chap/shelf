# Frontend & Backend environment variables for local development with Vite/Node
# IMPORTANT:
# - Never commit real secrets to source control.
# - Keys below are placeholders. Replace with your own when running locally.
# - Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the browser.
# - Backend (Node) reads variables without VITE_ via process.env.

# Frontend (Vite) - safe to expose in browser
# Unsplash Access Key (optional for backgrounds)
VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key



# Backend (Node/Encore runtime)
# Unsplash Access Key for server-side Unsplash API calls (optional)
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key
