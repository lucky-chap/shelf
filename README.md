## Environment Variables (Frontend vs Backend)

This project uses different environment variable conventions for the frontend (Vite) and the backend (Node/Encore):

- Frontend (Vite):
  - Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the browser.
  - Access with import.meta.env.VITE_YOUR_KEY.

- Backend (Node/Encore):
  - Access with process.env.YOUR_KEY (server-side only).

Create a .env file in the project root by copying .env.example and filling in your values.

Example .env:

VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_key
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_key
POLAR_API_KEY=your_polar_api_key
POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID=org_XXXXXXXXXXXX

Notes:
- Do not hardcode keys in code. Always use environment variables.
- Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the browser runtime.

## Optional Configuration

- Unsplash is OPTIONAL (enables Unsplash background selection in Theme Settings). If not set, the Unsplash option will be hidden.

Optional configuration:
- Frontend (Vite env, in .env):
  - VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY (optional, only for client-side references)

- Backend (Encore env/secrets, configured in Infrastructure tab or .env for local dev ONLY):
  - UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY (optional, used server-side when searching Unsplash)
  - POLAR_API_KEY (required to enable Store)
  - POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID (required to scope Polar API calls)

Important:
- Never put secret keys in frontend code.
- The Unsplash backend API validates that UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY is set, or returns a clear error.
- The Store backend validates that Polar keys are configured, or returns a clear error and hides store UI.

### Unsplash Configuration

- Backend env:
  - UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = your_unsplash_key (server-side)

- Frontend env:
  - VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = your_unsplash_key (used for enabling the UI option)

### Store (Polar.sh) Configuration

- Backend env (server-side only):
  - POLAR_API_KEY = your Polar API key
  - POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID = your Polar organization id

- Behavior:
  - If Polar keys are present, the Admin dashboard shows the Store tab for product management.
  - Public site shows a Store section listing products.
  - Checkout redirects to Polar. Delivery handled by Polar.
  - After a successful checkout, the UI shows a purchase confirmation message.

## General Notes

- Ensure .env is loaded for both Vite (frontend) and Node/Encore (backend).
- Never hardcode keys; always use environment variables.
- Clear errors are returned if configuration is missing or invalid.

## Legacy URL Redirects

The app redirects old store/product/checkout URLs to the homepage:
- /product/*
- /store/*
- /checkout/*
