## Introduction

`Shelf` is an open-source alternative to Linktree - simple, fast, themeable and fully yours.
Most existing open-source link-in-bio solutions feel outdated or lack key features, like analytics, guestbook signing etc (most proproietary ones even lack this) leaving creators stuck with closed platforms. Shelf changes that by offering a modern, lightweight, and customizable solution you can self-host, extend, and truly own.
