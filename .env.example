# Environment configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.
# The app will NOT run without valid values for the keys below.

# Frontend (Vite) - safe to expose in browser
# Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the frontend.
# Stripe Publishable Key (REQUIRED, must start with pk_)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_123

# Unsplash Access Key (optional, used for background images search)
VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key


# Backend (Node/Encore) - server-side only
# These are read via process.env on the backend.
# Stripe Secret Key (REQUIRED, must start with sk_)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_123
# Stripe Webhook Secret (OPTIONAL, required if you add webhooks; must start with whsec_)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_123

# Notes:
# - Do not hardcode keys in code. Always read from environment variables.
# - Frontend must use import.meta.env.VITE_* variables.
# - Backend must use process.env.* variables (this project also supports Encore's secret fallback).
